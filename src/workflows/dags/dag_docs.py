### AirQo devices hourly ETL
#### Purpose
Extract devices data from the api(or source database) and store it in bigquery.
#### Notes
- Imagine you had a many devices(100,000+) and had to extract them each time you were going to query their data.
- This pipeline extracts the data and store it in kafka for easy access to cancel out the repeatitive queries.
