### Re-calibrate Missing Calibrated Data Pipeline
#### Purpose
Automatically identifies, processes, and recalibrates missing air quality measurements by combining raw sensor data with weather data, ensuring data completeness and accuracy in the monitoring network.

#### Workflow Steps
1. **Device Identification** (`extract_devices_missing_calibrated_data`)
   - Identifies devices with missing calibrated data
   - Queries the previous day's data by default
   - Returns device and timestamp information

2. **Raw Data Extraction** (`extract_raw_data`)
   - Retrieves raw sensor measurements for identified devices
   - Returns data along with time range information
   - Uses multiple_outputs for efficient data passing

3. **Data Cleaning** (`clean_data_raw_data`)
   - Cleans raw low-cost sensor data
   - Applies device category and frequency-specific processing
   - Prepares data for aggregation

4. **Data Aggregation** (`aggregate`)
   - Aggregates cleaned sensor data
   - Optimizes data for weather merging
   - Implements low-cost sensor aggregation logic

5. **Weather Data Integration** (`extract_hourly_weather_data`)
   - Fetches corresponding weather data
   - Matches the time range of sensor data
   - Ensures temporal alignment

6. **Data Merging** (`merge_data`)
   - Combines aggregated sensor data with weather data
   - Creates comprehensive dataset for calibration
   - Preserves data relationships

7. **Calibration** (`calibrate`)
   - Applies calibration models by country
   - Uses filtered device-specific data
   - Generates final calibrated measurements

8. **Data Distribution**
   - Sends to BigQuery (`send_hourly_measurements_to_bigquery`)
   - Updates raw measurements (`send_raw_measurements_to_bigquery`)
   - Pushes to API endpoints (`send_hourly_measurements_to_api`)

#### Schedule
Runs daily at midnight (0 0 * * *)

#### Configuration
- Uses LOWCOST device category
- Processes hourly frequency data
- Integrates with multiple data sources (BigQuery, API)

#### Dependencies
- BigQuery access for data storage/retrieval
- Weather data service availability
- API endpoints for data distribution

#### Notes
- Ensures data quality through multi-step validation
- Maintains data consistency across platforms
- Critical for accurate air quality monitoring
- <a href="https://airqo.africa/" target="_blank">AirQo</a>

#### Performance Optimizations (October 2025)
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Reduced data extraction complexity from O(n×m×k) to O(n) using single batch operations
- **Execution Performance**: ~30 seconds processing time with optimal memory footprint
- **Batch Processing**: Single API call instead of nested loops for device data extraction

### AirQo Devices Computed Baselines
#### Purpose
Compute and store baseline statistics for AirQo devices in BigQuery.

This pipeline computes baseline metrics (e.g., quantiles, ECDF bins, mean, standard deviation) for device pollutants over a specified time window (e.g., weekly). It uses historical data to establish baselines for data drift detection, quality checks, and anomaly monitoring. The computed baselines are stored in BigQuery for ongoing analysis and alerting.

#### Notes
- The computation uses the `compute_device_site_baseline` method to process baselines for each device in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor.
- The pipeline is scheduled to run daily at midnight to update baselines regularly.
- Baselines are computed only if sufficient data is available (e.g., meeting minimum sample counts and coverage thresholds).
- Exceptions in individual device computations are logged but do not halt the entire pipeline.
