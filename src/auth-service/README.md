The authentication microservice is a crucial component of our application's security infrastructure. It handles user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected resources.

- Token-based Authentication: Utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication, allowing users to access protected endpoints with a valid token.
- Role-based Authorization: Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to define granular permissions and restrict certain actions to authorized roles.
- Token Validation: Verifies the authenticity and validity of tokens during authentication and authorization processes.
- User Profile Management: Allows users to update their profile information, including personal details and preferences.
