# Authentication Service

This authentication microservice is a crucial component of our application's security infrastructure. It handles user authentication & authorization, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected resources..

## Features

- User Registration: This allows new users to create an account by providing their credentials & completing the registration process.
- User Login: Provides a secure login mechanism for users to authenticate themselves and obtain an access token for subsequent requests.
- Password Management: Offers password reset and change functionalities to maintain user account security.
- Token-based Authentication: Utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication, allowing users to access protected endpoints with a valid token.
- Role-based Authorization: Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to define granular permissions and restrict certain actions to authorized roles.
- Token Validation: Verifies the authenticity and validity of tokens during authentication and authorization processes.
- User Profile Management: Allows users to update their profile information, including personal details and preferences.
- Security Measures: Implements industry-standard security practices, such as password hashing and encryption, to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to AirQo Analytics.
