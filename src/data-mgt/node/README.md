## Overview

This data management microservice is a Node.js-based application deployed using Docker. It retrieves measurements from another system related to devices and performs various transformations to enhance the data with more descriptive field names. Additionally, the microservice monitors faults in the device data and appropriately flags them.

## Features

- Transforms measurements into a new format with descriptive field names
- Performs additional data transformations as needed
- Monitors faults in device data and flags them for further analysis
