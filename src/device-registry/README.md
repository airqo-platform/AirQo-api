## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- Docker (if using Docker for deployment)
- npm
- A valid Google Cloud project and associated credentials if interacting with Google Cloud services.
- Redis (running and accessible) if using Redis for caching or other functionalities.
- If using Kafka, configure a Kafka broker, client ID and bootstrap servers.
- MongoDB (ensure a MongoDB instance is running, either locally or remotely. If running remotely, set DB_URL appropriately.)

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/airqo-platform/AirQo-api.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the microservice directory**

   ```bash
   cd AirQo-api/src/device-registry
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the service**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Running with Docker

1. **Build the Docker image**

   ```bash
   docker build --target={TARGET_STAGE} -t {IMAGE_NAME} .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container**

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name {CONTAINER_NAME} -p host-port:container-port {IMAGE_NAME}
   ```

After successfully running the container, you can test the respective endpoints.

## Deployment

This project utilizes Kubernetes for container orchestration.

1. **Build the image within the microservice's directory**

   ```bash
   docker build --target={TARGET_STAGE} -t {IMAGE_NAME} .
   ```

2. **Push the image to a Docker registry**

3. **Use the images in your Kubernetes deployment files accordingly**
