# Data Access and Privacy Policy

## Overview

Our air quality monitoring platform respects sensor ownership rights and provides flexible data access controls. This document explains what data you can access and when, whether you're using our website, mobile app, or requesting data programmatically.

## Types of Data Access

### Current Air Quality Data (Live/Recent Measurements)

**What it is**: Real-time and recent air quality readings taken within the last few hours or days.

**Access Policy**: Current data respects the privacy preferences of sensor owners and operators. Some sensors may have restricted access to protect privacy or comply with specific agreements.

**What to expect**:

- Public sensors and those in public monitoring programs: Full access to current data
- Community sensors without privacy restrictions: Full access to current data
- Privately owned or restricted sensors: Current data may not be available
- Inactive or offline sensors: No current data shown

### Historical Air Quality Data

**What it is**: Past air quality measurements collected over weeks, months, or years.

**Access Policy**: Historical data remains available for research, analysis, and trend monitoring purposes, even when current data access is restricted.

**What to expect**:

- Comprehensive access to past measurements for analysis and reporting
- Data remains available regardless of current privacy settings
- Supports long-term air quality studies and trend analysis
- Essential for understanding seasonal patterns and improvements over time

## Sensor Privacy Controls

### Public Sensors

- **Current Data**: Freely accessible to all users
- **Historical Data**: Freely accessible to all users
- **Use Cases**: Public health monitoring, community awareness, research

### Community Sensors

- **Current Data**: Accessible unless privacy restrictions are enabled
- **Historical Data**: Always accessible for community benefit
- **Use Cases**: Local environmental monitoring, neighborhood awareness

### Private/Restricted Sensors

- **Current Data**: Not publicly accessible (protects sensor owner privacy)
- **Historical Data**: Available for research and analysis purposes
- **Use Cases**: Personal monitoring, private property assessment, sensitive locations

## Why Different Access Levels?

### Protecting Privacy

Some sensor owners require privacy for their real-time data due to:

- Property privacy concerns
- Security considerations
- Contractual obligations
- Personal preference

### Enabling Research

Historical data access supports:

- Environmental research
- Policy development
- Health impact studies
- Long-term trend analysis

### Maintaining Transparency

This dual approach allows us to:

- Respect individual privacy choices
- Support scientific research and public health
- Provide comprehensive long-term environmental insights
- Balance personal rights with community benefits

## What This Means for Users

### Using Our Platform (Website/Mobile App)

**Real-time Monitoring**:

- You'll see current readings from all publicly accessible sensors
- Some areas may have limited current data due to privacy settings
- Data availability varies by location and sensor ownership

**Historical Analysis**:

- Comprehensive historical data available for all locations
- Complete picture of air quality trends over time
- Ideal for understanding long-term patterns and changes

### For Researchers and Analysts

**Current Studies**:

- Access to real-time data from public and community sensors
- May need to account for privacy restrictions in certain areas
- Representative data for most public health applications

**Historical Research**:

- Full access to comprehensive historical datasets
- Enables robust trend analysis and longitudinal studies
- Supports evidence-based environmental and health research

## Data Quality and Reliability

All data, whether current or historical, maintains the same quality standards:

- Regular calibration and maintenance of sensors
- Data validation and quality control processes
- Transparent reporting of data gaps or sensor issues
- Consistent measurement methodologies across the network

## Your Rights and Controls

### As a Data User

- Access to all publicly available current and historical data
- Clear indication when data is limited due to privacy settings
- Consistent access to historical data for research purposes

### As a Sensor Owner/Operator

- Control over current data sharing preferences
- Ability to set privacy restrictions while supporting research
- Participation in community health monitoring at your comfort level
- Option to contribute to scientific understanding through historical data
