# AirQo Device Status & Monitoring System

### Purpose

This document explains how our automated system tracks device connectivity status and measures the accuracy of those determinations. It's designed for team members who need to understand the system without diving into technical implementation details.

## What We Monitor

### Device Status

We track whether each device is currently online (transmitting data) or offline (not transmitting).

**Two Status Types**:

| Status Type         | What It Shows                | Updated When                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **isOnline**        | Primary device status        | Every hour at :45 (deployed devices) |
| **rawOnlineStatus** | Raw data transmission status | Every hour at :35 (all devices)      |

### Why Two Status Types?

- **rawOnlineStatus**: Fast detection using direct device transmissions
- **isOnline**: Higher quality determination using processed, calibrated data

Different device types use different status fields as their primary indicator.

---

## How Status is Determined

### Simple Logic

The system checks: **"Has the device sent data recently?"**

- **Yes** (within threshold) → Device is Online ✅
- **No** (beyond threshold) → Device is Offline ❌

### Time Thresholds

| Device Type              | Threshold | Why This Duration                           |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Deployed Devices**     | 5 hours   | Allows time for data calibration processing |
| **Mobile Devices**       | 1 hour    | Uses raw data, needs faster detection       |
| **Non-Deployed Devices** | 1 hour    | Testing phase, uses raw data                |

### Update Schedule

**Every Hour, Two Checks Run**:

**12:35** - Raw Status Job

- Checks ThingSpeak for recent device transmissions
- Updates `rawOnlineStatus` for all devices
- Also updates `isOnline` for mobile and non-deployed devices
- Takes ~8-10 minutes

**12:45** - Calibrated Status Job

- Checks database for recent calibrated measurements
- Updates `isOnline` for deployed devices
- Updates site status based on device data
- Takes ~7-10 minutes

**Result**: Every device is checked 48 times per day (24 hours × 2 jobs)

---

## Accuracy Tracking

### What We Measure

For each status check, we track whether our determination was correct:

```
Current Status: What the system currently shows (e.g., "online")
New Status: What the recent data tells us (e.g., "online")
Match? Yes → Correct check ✅
Match? No → Incorrect check ❌
```

### Accuracy Calculation

```
Accuracy = (Correct Checks / Total Checks) × 100%

Example:
Total checks: 1,000
Correct: 950
Incorrect: 50
Accuracy: 95%
```

### What Gets Tracked

For each device:

- **totalChecks**: How many times we've checked the device
- **correctChecks**: Times our status was right
- **incorrectChecks**: Times our status was wrong
- **accuracyPercentage**: Overall accuracy rate
- **lastCheck**: When we last checked
- **lastIncorrectReason**: Why the last incorrect check failed (e.g., "timeout", "fetch_error")

## Common Status Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Device Working Normally

```
Device: aq_device_001
Status: deployed
isOnline: true
lastActive: 2024-11-16 12:30:00 (15 minutes ago)
Accuracy: 98%
```

**What this means**: Device is transmitting data regularly, system is correctly identifying it as online.

### Scenario 2: Device Offline

```
Device: aq_device_042
Status: deployed
isOnline: false
lastActive: 2024-11-16 06:00:00 (6 hours ago)
Accuracy: 97%
```

**What this means**: Device hasn't sent data for 6 hours (beyond 5-hour threshold), correctly marked offline.

### Scenario 3: Recent Recovery

```
Device: aq_device_156
Status: deployed
isOnline: true
lastActive: 2024-11-16 12:40:00 (5 minutes ago)
Previous offline: 2 hours
Accuracy: 98%
```

**What this means**: Device was offline, now back online. System detected recovery in next hourly check.

### Scenario 4: Low Accuracy

```
Device: aq_device_089
Status: deployed
isOnline: true
lastActive: 2024-11-16 12:35:00 (10 minutes ago)
Accuracy: 88%
lastIncorrectReason: "fetch_error"
```

**What this means**: Device is working but system has trouble determining status accurately. May indicate network issues or configuration problems.

## Why Checks Might Be Incorrect

### Common Reasons

| Reason                | What It Means                           | Typical Cause                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **fetch_error**       | Failed to retrieve data from ThingSpeak | API issues, network problems   |
| **timeout**           | Request took too long                   | Slow network, high server load |
| **invalid_timestamp** | Data timestamp failed validation        | Clock skew, corrupted data     |
| **network_latency**   | Data in transit during check            | Timing issue, normal delay     |
| **no_readkey**        | Missing API credentials                 | Configuration issue            |

### Accuracy Improvement Areas

When accuracy drops below 95% for a device, common causes include:

- Intermittent network connectivity
- Data processing delays
- ThingSpeak API instability
- Device hardware issues
- Configuration problems

## Data Quality Checks

### PM2.5 Validation

Not all data that arrives gets stored. We validate PM2.5 values:

**Valid PM2.5 Must**:

- Not be null or undefined
- Be a number
- Be between 0 and 1,000 μg/m³

**What Happens to Invalid Values**:

- ❌ Not stored in device's latest PM2.5 reading
- ✅ Device still marked as online (connectivity is separate from data quality)
- 📊 Logged for troubleshooting

### Out-of-Order Events

Sometimes data arrives out of chronological order. The system handles this:

```
10:00 - Device sends Event A (PM2.5: 15)
10:05 - Event A processed → lastActive = 10:00

10:10 - Device sends Event B (PM2.5: 20)
10:12 - Event B processed → lastActive = 10:10

10:15 - Event A arrives again (duplicate)
        → lastActive stays 10:10 (not updated with old timestamp)
        → Accuracy still tracked
```

**Rule**: We only update timestamps if new data is actually newer than what we already have.

### Key Concepts Summary

#### Device Status

- **Online**: Device is transmitting data within its expected time threshold.
- **Offline**: Device has not transmitted data within its threshold.
- **Threshold**: 5 hours for deployed static devices, 1 hour for mobile/non-deployed devices.

#### Accuracy

- **Definition**: A measure of how often our system correctly identifies a device's online or offline status.
- **Calculation**: `(Correct Checks / Total Checks) * 100%`.
- **Target**: ≥98% accuracy across the network.

#### Jobs

- **Raw Status Job (:35/hour)**: Checks raw data from ThingSpeak for all devices. Provides fast but less processed status.
- **Calibrated Status Job (:45/hour)**: Checks processed, calibrated data from our database for deployed devices. Provides a higher-quality, more reliable status.

#### Device Types

- **Static Deployed**: Fixed-location devices using the 5-hour calibrated data threshold.
- **Mobile**: Vehicle-mounted devices using the 1-hour raw data threshold for faster updates.
- **Non-Deployed**: Devices in testing or storage, also using the 1-hour raw data threshold.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q: Why do we check devices twice per hour?

**A**: Two different data sources with different purposes:

- **Raw Data Check (:35)**: Provides a quick, near-real-time indication of connectivity directly from the device's transmissions.
- **Calibrated Data Check (:45)**: Provides a more reliable, "source-of-truth" status based on data that has successfully passed through our entire processing and quality control pipeline.

#### Q: What does 97.8% accuracy mean?

**A**: Out of every 100 status checks, approximately 98 are correct. We're tracking whether the system accurately identifies if a device is online or offline.

#### Q: Why 5 hours for deployed devices but 1 hour for mobile?

**A**: The different thresholds account for data processing time and device behavior:

- **5 hours (Deployed)**: Calibrated data takes time to be processed, cleaned, and stored. The 5-hour window provides a safe buffer to ensure high-quality data is used for status checks without prematurely marking a device as offline.
- **1 hour (Mobile/Non-Deployed)**: These devices rely on raw data, which has very low latency. A shorter 1-hour threshold allows for faster detection of connectivity issues, which is crucial for mobile devices that frequently change location and network conditions.

#### Q: What happens when a device goes offline?

**A**:

1. System detects in next hourly check (within 1 hour)
2. Status updated to offline
3. Accuracy tracked
4. Alert generated if device was previously online
5. Operations team notified

#### Q: Can accuracy be 100%?

**A**: In practice, no. There will always be some edge cases:

- Brief network outages during checks
- Data processing delays
- Timing issues between device transmission and status check
- External API instability

Target of 98% accounts for these unavoidable issues.

#### Q: How is this different from device uptime?

**A**:

- **Status**: Is the device online right now? (current moment)
- **Uptime**: What percentage of time was the device online? (historical average)
- **Accuracy**: How often do we correctly identify the status? (system reliability)

All three are different metrics measuring different things.
