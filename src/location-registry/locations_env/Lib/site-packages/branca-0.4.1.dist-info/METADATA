        # Branca
        
        This library is a spinoff from [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium),
        that would host the non-map-specific features.
        
        It may become a HTML+JS generation library in the future.
        
        It is based on Jinja2 only.
        
        There's no documentation,
        but you can [browse the examples](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/python-visualization/branca/tree/master/examples) gallery.
