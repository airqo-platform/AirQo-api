    Is node a true endpoint of an edge.

    Return True if the node is a "real" endpoint of an edge in the network,
    otherwise False. OSM data includes lots of nodes that exist only as points
    to help streets bend around curves. An end point is a node that either:
    1) is its own neighbor, ie, it self-loops.
    2) or, has no incoming edges or no outgoing edges, ie, all its incident
       edges point inward or all its incident edges point outward.
