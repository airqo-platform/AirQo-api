# GitHub Security Documentation Overview

This document summarizes key resources and best practices from [GitHub Security Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security).

## Quickstart for Securing Your Repository

- Manage access to your code.
- Find and fix vulnerable code and dependencies automatically.
- Enable secret scanning and push protection to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.

## Key Features

- **Secret Scanning:** Detect and block pushes containing secrets or credentials.
- **Dependabot:** Automatically find and fix vulnerable dependencies.
- **Code Scanning:** Identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in your codebase.
- **Security Advisories:** Coordinate private vulnerability disclosures and manage advisories.
- **Security Alerts:** Receive notifications about vulnerabilities and recommended fixes.

## Best Practices

- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts.
- Regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities.
- Limit repository access using the principle of least privilege.
- Audit and monitor security alerts and actions.
- Avoid storing secrets or credentials in your repositories.
