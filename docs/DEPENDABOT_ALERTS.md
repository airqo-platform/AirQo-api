# Dependabot Alerts

Dependabot helps you keep your dependencies secure and up to date by automatically alerting you to vulnerabilities and providing fix suggestions.

## How Dependabot Works

- Scans your repository for dependency files.
- Alerts you to known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
- Can automatically open pull requests to update vulnerable dependencies.

## Using Dependabot

- Enable Dependabot alerts in your repositoryâ€™s security settings.
- Review and merge Dependabot pull requests to keep dependencies secure.
- Configure Dependabot via `.github/dependabot.yml` for custom update schedules and ecosystems.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and address Dependabot alerts.
- Test dependency updates before merging.
- Keep your dependency files up to date to maximize coverage.
